# Maternal Health Research 

This research investigates the impact of bias on health outcomes for Black women, focusing particularly on maternal health. 
It proposes strategies to mitigate bias through personalized engagement for pregnant women to effectively learn about their personal health. A proposed computational framework consisting of machine learning and natural language processing models is used on Fitbit data for early detection and intervention.
