# Maternal Health Research 

This research investigates the impact of bias on health outcomes for Black women, focusing particularly on maternal health. 
It proposes strategies to mitigate bias through personalized engagement for pregnant women to effectively learn about their personal health. A proposed computational framework consisting of machine learning and natural language processing models is used on Fitbit data for early detection and intervention.

## Conceptual Design

1. Dashboard - Interactive, pretty, and sleek (Good Awareness/Risk Awareness Sides)
2. Manual Input - Weight, Calories, Blood Pressure, Glucose, mental health, symptoms
3. Notifications - Sleep, Activity, Heart Rate, Food Intake, etc.
4. Fetal Progress - Size comparison (orange, melon, etc.), Monthly Bump Pictures 
5. Geospatial Element - Analyzing the populations that would benefit most from this tracking
6. Monitoring - 
- Sleep Patterns (quality of sleep)
- Activity (types is it low intensity â€”> high etc. is their heart beating irregular when moving?)
- Heart Rate (Anomalies, threshold, and pattern recognition)
- Food Intake (Calories Tracker will maybe integrate myfitne)

## Methods
- Normalization and Data Preprocessing
- Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forests & Local Outlier Factor
- Threshold Analysis
- Automated Recommendations 

## Installation
To be determined.
## Usage
To be determined.
