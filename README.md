# Maternal Health Research 

The research investigates the impact of bias on health outcomes for Black women, focusing particularly on maternal care. 
It proposes strategies to mitigate bias through personalized education, exemplified by the development of a mobile application aimed at
providing access to relevant health information and resources. Additionally, the study is currently designing and implementing a model
alert system and virtual coaching program, tailored to modern attention spans, to enhance maternal health monitoring and support. 
Through these ongoing efforts, the research aims to contribute to improved outcomes and equity in healthcare for Black women.
